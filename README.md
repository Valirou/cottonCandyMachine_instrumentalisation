# cottonCandyMachine_instrumentalization
This repository contains the programmation needed to extract data and to control the heating circuit of a cotton candy machine. The model of the cotton candy machine is a Super Floss Maxx from Gold Medal. The modified circuit includes a new control of the rotating head temperature with an Arduino MEGA combine with a MLX90614 for the reading of the temperature, a SEN0098 for the reading of current and VCNL4010 with a magnet for the reading of the number of revolutions. Although, this project could be reused for another device.
